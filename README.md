# API Sample Test

## Getting Started

This project requires a newer version of Node. Don't forget to install the NPM packages afterwards.

You should change the name of the ```.env.example``` file to ```.env```.

Run ```node app.js``` to get things started. Hopefully the project should start without any errors.

## Explanations

The actual task will be explained separately.

This is a very simple project that pulls data from HubSpot's CRM API. It pulls and processes company and contact data from HubSpot but does not insert it into the database.

In HubSpot, contacts can be part of companies. HubSpot calls this relationship an association. That is, a contact has an association with a company. We make a separate call when processing contacts to fetch this association data.

The Domain model is a record signifying a HockeyStack customer. You shouldn't worry about the actual implementation of it. The only important property is the ```hubspot```object in ```integrations```. This is how we know which HubSpot instance to connect to.

The implementation of the server and the ```server.js``` is not important for this project.

Every data source in this project was created for test purposes. If any request takes more than 5 seconds to execute, there is something wrong with the implementation.

## Hubspot Meeting Task

There is an engagement type called meeting in HubSpot. When a salesperson meets with a contact, they create a meeting through HubSpot for it.

1. Just like how we've done it for contacts and companies, write a method in the `worker.js` file that pulls and processes the meetings. Pull the meeting title and some timestamp properties from the meeting object. This worker will ideally run on a daily basis to get newly modified meetings.

2. You need to insert two actions as a result of this processing: `Meeting Created` (when that meeting record was created in HubSpot) and `Meeting Updated` (whenever it isnâ€™t a Created action).

3. Store which contact attended the meeting along with the meeting properties. HubSpot normally doesn't give this data at the same time with the meetings so you should find another way to get it. At the end, you should have each meeting as a separate action along with the **email** of the contact which attended the meeting.

4. Write a short debrief (about 8-10 sentences is enough) on how you would improve this project in terms of (1) code quality and readability, (2) project architecture, and especially (3) code performance.

5. Send the code and the debrief to us through a new Github repo that you create.

Disclaimer: You'll primarily (but not only) work in the `worker.js` file. The code itself isn't very well written, but this is part of the test. The tradeoffs you make to deliver this feature tell us more about how you work in a fast-paced environment. Aim for around 2-3 hours of work.
